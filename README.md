## Video Presentation

For a visual demonstration of how the Bookstore API works and its various functionalities, you can watch the video presentation available [here](TODO!!!). In this presentation, I walk through the key features of the application, demonstrate its usage with examples, and provide insights into the development process.

## SQL Database Diagram
Below is a simplified representation of the database schema used in the Bookstore API:

This diagram illustrates the relationships between different entities in the database, including tables for users, books, categories, shopping carts, orders, and more.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Docker installed and docker engine running.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `./mvnw clean package` to create a .jar file.
5. In the .env file you should provide necessary DB and Docker variables, here is an example:  
MYSQLDB_USER=root  
MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=1234  
MYSQLDB_DATABASE=test  
MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT=3307  
MYSQLDB_DOCKER_PORT=3306  
SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=8080  
SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=8080  
DEBUG_PORT=5005  
6. Run `docker compose up -d --build` to start the application and MySQL database.
7. Feel free to test my application using Postman/Swagger.
8. To stop and remove containers use `docker compose down`.

## Rising to Challenges

Since this is my first relatively comprehensive project, I encountered a few difficulties while working with it. Some of which I was able to deal with fairly quickly, but some of which were able to keep me up at night, solving the most difficult problems was what satisfied me the most. The issues I encountered allowed me to develop the ability to effectively search for solutions, whether using the information in the available documentation, the reliable Stack Overflow or sites like Baeldung. Thanks to the knowledge I gained, I know that the future obstacles in my path I will be able to overcome more and more efficiently.
